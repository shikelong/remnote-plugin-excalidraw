# 🎨 Embed Excalidraw Plugin for RemNote

The Embed Excalidraw plugin lets you seamlessly integrate an Excalidraw board into your RemNote workspace. Now, creating Excalidraw illustrations right within RemNote becomes a breeze! 🖌️ What's more? All board elements and state are stored at the user-level in RemNote, ensuring effortless synchronization and restoration across various devices and platforms. 🔄

## 🚀 Usage

1. To create a new Excalidraw board in RemNote, simply type the slash command `/excalidraw`.
2. Let your creativity take over! Start drawing! 🎨
3. Have an existing `.excalidraw` file? Import it easily using the `Open` menu in the left area. 📁
4. This plugin also supports features such as `export`, `view mode`, and `save to image`. Unfortunately, the custom library feature is not yet supported. 🗂️

## 📝 TODO

- [ ] `Known issue` 🚨: Excalidraw Library is currently not supported. The page will be redirected to localhost:8000, so the Library cannot be added to the board.
- [ ] `Fast Follow` Implement full-screen mode support. 🖥️
- [ ] `Need Spike`,`Fast Follow` Enable embedding of existing Excalidraw boards. 🖼️
- [ ] `Fast Follow` Use slot to customize board's height.
