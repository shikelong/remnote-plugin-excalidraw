## 📌 Embed Excalidraw Plugin
This plugin allows you to embed an Excalidraw board in RemNote. You can create Excalidraw drawings directly in RemNote. The board's elements and state are stored as user-level data in RemNote, enabling synchronization and restoration across different devices and platforms. 🔄

## 📝 TODO
- [] `Known issue` 🚨: Excalidraw plugins are currently not supported. The page will be redirected to localhost:8000, and Excalidraw cannot be added to the board.
- [] Implement full-screen mode support. 🖥️
- [] Enhance configuration: Add support for themes, height, etc. ⚙️
- [] Enable embedding of existing Excalidraw boards. 🖼️
